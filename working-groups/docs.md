## Purpose

To inform and assist with best practices for documentation in open source projects, and also help fund documentation related tooling projects.

## Goals

- To connect those who contribute to documentation. To each other, and to projects that need help and advice.
- To maintain a page of these resources.

## Guiding questions

- What is documentation?
- Who writes documentation?

## Reports and documents

- Initially, there's the notes from the Sustain Meeting. These are shared on the Google Drive, and could be turned into a report.
