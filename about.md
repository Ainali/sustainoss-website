## About Sustain

It all started with a [tweet](https://twitter.com/jdorfman/status/801558965423222784) in November 2016.
Six months later, one hundred people gathered in San Francisco and created a cultural shift in how we
think about the sustainability of open source software.

After the event, a [report](/assets/pdf/SustainOSS-west-2017-report.pdf) was written and a definition
was born, sustainerâ€”the individual or organization who is concerned with the fragile state and future
of highly-used and impactful open source projects. If that sounds like something you identify with,
you should [join us](/tickets/).

Sustain events are led by a facilitator. There are no keynotes, talks, or sponsor demos.
Your undivided attention is **required**. Phones and laptops should not be used throughout the day
and you will be asked to put devices away if they are a distraction to you or anyone else.

This years organizers are:

* [Pia Mancini](https://www.piamancini.com/) - pia at sustainoss.org
* [Justin Dorfman](https://www.justindorfman.com/) - jd at sustainoss.org

This years facilitator is:

* [Alan "Gunner" Gunn](https://aspirationtech.org/about/people/gunner)

You may contact them if you have any questions or concerns.
You can also join us on [Changelog's Community Slack](https://changelog.com/community) (#sustain)
